# Foodie Roulette

Foodie Roulette is a web application that suggests random restaurants based on user input, such as location, distance, category, and rating. This project was created with the help of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI.

## Project Creation

This project was developed in collaboration with GPT-4, an advanced AI language model. The process involved using GPT-4's text generation capabilities to provide code snippets, tests, and refactor instructions for the app. The user acted as a conduit, taking the AI-generated instructions and implementing them to create the final product. Through an iterative process, the user asked GPT-4 questions and provided feedback to refine and improve the app.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the creation of Foodie Roulette:

1. **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project is structured as a React app, with components for the header, form, and restaurant display.
2. **Azure Functions**: A serverless compute service that allows running small pieces of code without managing infrastructure. An Azure Function was used to create a backend API for fetching restaurant data from the Yelp API.
3. **Yelp API**: A public API that provides access to Yelp's extensive database of restaurants and businesses. The app uses the Yelp API to fetch a list of restaurants based on user inputs.
4. **Azure Static Web Apps**: A service that automatically builds and deploys full-stack web apps from a GitHub or Azure DevOps repository. The project is configured to be deployed as an Azure Static Web App, which includes both the frontend and the backend API.
5. **CSS**: The app uses CSS to style components and make the design responsive for different screen sizes.

## Tests

As part of the development process, GPT-4 provided instructions for creating unit tests for the React components in the app. These tests ensure that the app behaves as expected when the user interacts with it. The tests cover form submission, API calls, and restaurant display functionality.

## Refactoring

Throughout the project's development, GPT-4 suggested various refactoring steps to improve code quality, organization, and maintainability. These recommendations included splitting the app into separate components, moving constants and utility functions to separate files, and organizing components in a dedicated folder.

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible by the assistance of GPT-4, a powerful AI language model developed by OpenAI. The user's role as a conduit allowed for the successful implementation of GPT-4's instructions and the creation of the Foodie Roulette app.
